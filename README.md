## Assignment 8: NumPy
The NumPy package (module) is used in almost all numerical computation using Python. It is a package that provides high-performance
vector, matrix and higher-dimensional data structures for Python. It is implemented in C and Fortran so when calculations are vectorized
(formulated with vectors and matrices), performance is very good.

Follow through the attached notebook to run and complete all cells. Make sure you read the instructions to learn the steps (the goal
isn't to complete it quickly but to learn the steps).
